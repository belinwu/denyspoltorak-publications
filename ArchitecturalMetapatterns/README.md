This is the source directory for *Architectural Metapatterns: The Pattern Language of Software Architecture*.

Here you can download the latest version of the book as PDF, EPUB or ODT. Or you can read it online as a [wiki](https://github.com/denyspoltorak/metapatterns/wiki).

The subfolders contain diagrams used throughout the book in PNG and VSDX format. Sadly, color gradients were lost on saving LucidChart drawings to VSDX. Please contact me if you need access to the original diagrams.
