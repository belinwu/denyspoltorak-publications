# Architectural Metapatterns

The main content of this repository is my book ***Architectural Metapatterns: The Pattern Language of Software Architecture*** (2024-2025). It provides:

* A compendium of architectural patterns and styles
* An ontology of patterns based on their structure and function
* A brief overview of basic principles of software design
* A comparison of ways in which various patterns approach the same problems
* A map of evolutions of software architectures

The book can be downloaded as PDF or EPUB files from the [latest release](https://github.com/denyspoltorak/metapatterns/releases/tag/v1.1) or read online as a [wiki](https://github.com/denyspoltorak/metapatterns/wiki). The book's diagrams and ODT file are also [available](ArchitecturalMetapatterns) under the [CC BY license](ArchitecturalMetapatterns/LICENSE).

There is also [Leanpub page](https://leanpub.com/metapatterns) with testimonials and detailed table of contents and the original (outdated) [Medium series](https://medium.com/itnext/the-list-of-architectural-metapatterns-ed64d8ba125d).
